what do I have to say today? just another short day. i spent hours trying to 
clean up my reading room, wan't impressive but satisfactory. some time was also
spent on translating sentences in duolingo, kinda fun. 

resume to read cpl regularly, it's really an annoyingly great book. found 
tomas transtromer's poetry and memoir, bought 12 22 2012. it's calming and
powerful. it's lively and has the dim light of sweden. i saw a pic of his mom, 
looks a bit like nic. made me miss her. i would fall in love with her every
time we meet.
