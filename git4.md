ahhem, almost forgot to write. something more about tomas transtromer. his 
comparison of himself to the tree circles (or whatever it's called). it gives
a strong emotion. do i remember every face i had? i should, but too lazy to 
retrieve. should stop living and forgeting. 
i got up a lot earlier without an alarm. human beings are slaves. when you whip
em they become lazier. 
want to go to the desert. want to be at the top of the world with my most 
beloved ones.
