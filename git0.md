i want to commit at least once per day while not traveling, from today. 
here's something i found out bout github and stackoverflow as a newcomer. 

i'm trying to get some itermmediate/beginer practice for c and also look for
resources to learn other languages, then there was a list of free programming
books. there are even books avail in other languages (natural lang) like russian
german and czech. it'd be fun to learn a new prog lang and a natural lang side
by side. 

then somehow i wandered to stackoverflow and saw this add for their career
feature. cool thing was you can find many compnies oversea looking for coders. 
to me the ones in berlin would be perfect but i still need to work hard. it's 
perhaps a new way to travel the world?
