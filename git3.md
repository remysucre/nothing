rain raged this morning. don't remember things before noon. met high school 
friend, funny girl. before that coded very shortly. 
finished minnena ser mig in a day, tomas seems doesn't want me to stay up. 
in my imagination, his lifestyle should be as simple as his writings. should
also be healthy. 
the old, maybe not tht old, guy playing at the subway exit and counted money. 
is he satisfied? is he in pain?
depression is a part of life. it's painful, but it's a part of life.
